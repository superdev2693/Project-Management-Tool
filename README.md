## How to build this application in your local machine
This project is made using Intellij IDEA. So, I would **recommand** you to build this project using Intellij IDEA. 
1. Install Intellij IDEA Community Edition from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) if you haven't installed it already. 
2. Fork & clone/download the source code of this repository in your PC.
3. Open the project with Intellij IDEA Community Edition and install the required JDK suggested by the IDE. Alternatively, you can download the JDK 8 from [here](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All) and use it to build and run the project. 
4. Install MySQL in your PC. To do that you can download & install [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/). You can access the MySQL database in the web. The default address is [http://localhost/phpMyAdmin](http://localhost/phpMyAdmin). However, it may vary depending on your configuration. 
5. Import this [sql dump](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11xXaQZtOtOGu_15sxblVy9ffhYsyfwbf/view?usp=sharing) in the MySQL database.
