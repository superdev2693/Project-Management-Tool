### How to Build this tool in your local environment ?
This project is made with Intellij IDEA. So, I would **recommand** you to build this project using Intellij IDEA. 
1. Install Intellij IDEA from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) if you don't already have it installed. You can install Community Edition. But if you are a student you can get the Ultimate Edition for free submitting your student identity info.
2. Fork & clone / download the source code of this repository in your PC.
3. We have stored information about different projects in a MySQL Database. You need the create a database with following 3 Tables with columns with mentioned datatypes. If you use the Ultimate Edition of Intellij IDEA, you can create the database inside the IDE. If you are a Community Edition user you can make the database with [sequel pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) / [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)  

    Table name    | Column Name    |  Column Name
    ------------- | -------------  | ------------
    user          | ```username```   |  ```passowrd```

4. Config the database with application. You may need to edit [```Connnect.java```](https://github.com/atiqueahmedziad/Easy-Project-Management-Tool/blob/master/src/App/Connect.java) with your database name, user and password.
5. In ```User``` Table, make a row with ```username``` and ```password```. You will use the username and password for login authentication.
